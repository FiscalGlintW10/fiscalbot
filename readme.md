<h1>Fiscal's Secretary Bot: Archived Project</h1>

This is a Discord bot made by **FiscalGlintW10#6296** using **discord.py v2.0**, and was used for a long time in his official server (link: https://discord.gg/qsjAJ82Bb5). Over time, due to uptime and hosting issues, it was retired. The entire project thus was open-sourced by me, maybe to get ideas if you're looking to build a Discord bot, or looking for snippets of code.


You are allowed to re-distribute the project with consent from FiscalGlintW10#6296 on Discord. You may use a bot made using this code freely in your server(s), and share it with your friends for use in their servers.


Please be aware that this bot does NOT support application commands (or / commands). It supports text commands using a prefix (pre-set one is !, you can change it). 


<h2>Steps to use the bot:</h2>

**Please ensure that you have python installed first.**

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Create a new application, make it a bot.
3. Click "Reset Token", then copy the new token.
4. Paste your token in the last line in main.py:

   `bot.run("token")` - replace "token" with your bot's.


I am solely indebted to YouTube and various other internet guides relating to discord.py, and the discord.py Discord server (https://discord.gg/dpy) in the building of this bot. Alongside, I acknowledge many of my Discord friends for providing me ideas for this bot. Without them, the *raidreport* feature wouldn't have been a thing.



<h3>Thanks for supporting me, hope you have fun using this bot!</h3>
